It is our responsibility as builders to first seek to understand the problem, before
diving into solutions.

We concern ourselves with design, technical, and business domains;
taking an active part in each to shape the product and empower others to do the same.

Our craft combines _Product Thinking_ with great technical execution.

We take great professional pride in the products we ship and refuse to
limit ourselves to technical-only roles in our teams.

## The Product Engineer Mindset

In our work as _Product Engineers_, we have come to value:

- **Continuous delivery of working software** over promises and estimations
- **Asking why** to understand the customer problem before diving into code
- **Customer collaboration and feedback** over tickets and second-hand knowledge
- **Teamwork and communication** over picking up tasks and working in isolation
- **Testing the product ourselves** over relying on others (especially our users) to find issues
- **Domain knowledge and ownership** over outsourcing strategic thinking to someone else
