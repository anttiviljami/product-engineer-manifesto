<h1>Product Engineer Manifesto</h1>
</div>

We see ourselves first and foremost as Builders, with a strong foundation in software engineering.

Our craft combines *Product Thinking* with technical execution.

We concern ourselves with matters of design and quality in the technical,
aesthetic, and business domains, taking an active part in each to shape the
product and empower others to do the same.

We are deeply committed to the products we help create,
embracing a broader role beyond just technical contributions within our teams.

Our collective aspiration is to create outstanding products. We believe that to achieve this,
it's essential to have builders on the team who are in tune with our customers' needs and dedicated to meeting them.

## The Product Engineer Mindset

In our work as *Product Engineers*, we have come to value:

- **Continuous delivery of working software** over promises and estimations
- **Asking why** to deeply understand the customer problem before diving into code
- **Customer collaboration and feedback** over tickets and second-hand knowledge
- **Teamwork and communication** over picking up tasks and working in isolation
- **Using the product ourselves** over relying on others to test our software
- **Strategic thinking** and understanding the market and context you're operating in
