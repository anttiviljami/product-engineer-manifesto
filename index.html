    <p>We consider ourselves <em>Builders</em> first, software engineers second.</p>

    <p>Our craft combines <em>Product Thinking</em> with technical execution.</p>

    <p>We concern ourselves with matters of design and quality in the technical,
      aesthetic, and business domains, taking an active part in each to shape the
      product and empower others to do the same.</p>

    <p>We take great professional pride in our products as a whole and refuse to
      limit ourselves to technical-only roles in our teams.</p>

    <p>Our shared goal is simply to build great products, and recognize that achieving
      this requires builders who deeply understand the customer's needs.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-wide" id="the-product-engineer-mindset">The Product Engineer Mindset</h2>

    <p>In our work as <em>Product Engineers</em>, we have come to value:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
      <li><strong>Continuous delivery of working software</strong> over promises and estimations</li>

      <li><strong>Asking why</strong> to deeply understand the customer problem before diving into code</li>

      <li><strong>Customer collaboration and feedback</strong> over tickets and second-hand knowledge</li>

      <li><strong>Teamwork and communication</strong> over picking up tasks and working in isolation</li>

      <li><strong>Using the product ourselves</strong> over relying on others to test our software</li>

      <li><strong>Strategic thinking</strong> and understanding the market and context you&#39;re operating in</li>
    </ul>
